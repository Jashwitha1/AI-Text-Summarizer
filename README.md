# AI-Text-Summarizer
I built a Text Summarizer in Python using HuggingFace Transformers that can take long paragraphs or articles and turn them into short, easy-to-read summaries. The goal was to make reading faster and smarter by cutting out the noise while keeping the main idea intact. Along the way, I worked with NLP techniques, pre-trained GenAI models, and Python.
